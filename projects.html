                <h2>Projekt Grötvik 2024–2025</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Client:</strong> Trafikverket<br>
                    <strong>Role:</strong> Workshop designer & research lead<br>
                    <strong>Focus:</strong> Sustainable tourism & seasonal mobility in Grötvik
                </p>
                <p>
                    How can design support sustainable tourism and mobility while preserving the unique identity of Grötvik? As research lead, I engaged residents and stakeholders through participatory workshops and ethnographic research, uncovering both everyday challenges and long-term aspirations for the area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result: a conceptual proposal for a flexible, modular hub "FLEX-HIVE" shaped by local voices and designed to foster community, orientation, and sustainable micro-mobility.

                <h2>Active8 Planet 2021–2022</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Clients:</strong> Volvo Cars, European Union, Halmstad University<br>
                    <strong>Role:</strong> UX designer & workshop facilitator<br>
                    <strong>Focus:</strong> Ecological sustainability in the mobility sector
                </p>
                <p>
                    How can design put the planet at the center of mobility innovation? As a UX designer, I helped shape research and design processes, facilitating workshops and gathering insights to address complex sustainability challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result: a speculative, card-based training game for agile teams, encouraging empathy for the planet by visualizing the impact of everyday decisions. The concept was tested and iterated in pilot workshops, with digital elements added for a dynamic experience.

                <p>
                    <strong>Client:</strong> ViaViridi<br>
                    <strong>Role:</strong> Project leader<br>
                    <strong>Focus:</strong> Sustainable design tools for the construction industry
                </p>
                <p>
                    How can digital tools make sustainability accessible in construction? As project leader, I guided the team and stakeholders in developing a user-friendly Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool, focused on simplifying complex data and workflows for non-experts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result: a digital, card-based tool that streamlines LCA and EPD processes, making sustainability more approachable and efficient for clients.
